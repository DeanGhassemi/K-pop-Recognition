# K-pop-Recognition

## Inspiration
When I first got into K-pop, it was only for the music. Then I slowly transitioned into getting to know the members of the groups I liked the most. As someone who is new into K-pop, it is hard getting to know who is who when some groups have over 4 members. And even as someone who has been enjoying the music for over 5 years, I struggle to recognize the differences in groups with over 9 members. 
WJSN had 10 members
Iz*One had 12 members
TripleS had 24 members!

## Starting Point
I have always been interested in facial recognition and had prior knowledge of python. This [video](https://youtu.be/535acCxjHCI?si=ukcc0JfOT3GHT4hr) by Sentdex gave me an amazing starting point and understanding of how to use the face recognition library along with opencv and os.

## Features
So far it is only working with NewJeans. Before I add more groups, I want to make it more precise.

## Plans
I want to add more groups, incorporate scikit-learn to make it more precise, turn it into a full developed web app so others can upload their own images and have those analyzed for recognition.
